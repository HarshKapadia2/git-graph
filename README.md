## Usage

-   Select the `.git` directory of a repository for the graph to render.
    -   If the `.git` directory is not visible in the directory picker, please enable hidden file viewing on the local machine.
    -   Extremely huge repositories might not load due to browser memory constraints.
    -   'Packed repo' error: Please unpack **all** the [packfiles](https://git.harshkapadia.me/#_the_pack_directory) (`.pack` files) in the repository. ([Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cauIy20JhFs))
-   Using the Branch Selector, any local branch can be visualized.
    -   'No branch' error: No branches could be found. Either the directory uploaded is not a `.git` directory or the repository has no commits in the checked out branch.
-   Using the Commit Selector, one or more Commits and their corresponding Trees and Blobs can be highlighted.
-   Hover over objects and click on the 'Raw' button to view the raw contents of that Git Object.
